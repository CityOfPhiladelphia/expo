        <h1>Workshops</h1>
        <h3>Literacy and Education Workshop</h3>
        In today’s economy, education is the key to employment. As technology progresses, changes in GED testing are fast approaching. With our interactive workshop, people who want to advance their careers or find employment can find all of the information necessary for classes and testing from various providers across Philadelphia.
         
        <h3>Legal Services Workshop</h3>
        This workshop will provide a general discussion of legal issues ranging from court costs to child support, and is designed to help returning citizens navigate their way through the often-complex legal system. Angus Love, an attorney who specializes in ex-offender issues, will be among the panelists.
         
        <h3>Interview Preparation Workshop</h3>
        A great interview is one of the most important steps to finding employment. This workshop will feature a mock-interview process with top HR professionals and career services experts.
         
        <h3>Explaining Your Criminal Record/Ban the Box Workshop</h3>
        Explaining a criminal history to potential employers can often be difficult and unnerving. The ‘Ban the Box’ Legislation, which makes this easier, will be explained by Rue Landau from the City’s Commission on Human Relations. There will also be a focus on finding the best ways to tell employers about this history.
         
        <h3>Expungement/Pardon Workshop</h3>
        In Pennsylvania, each arrest creates a publicly available record that can be sold and shared regardless of the arrest’s final disposition, including arrests not leading to conviction, acquittals, or not guilty verdicts. Featuring the ‘Philadelphia Lawyers for Social Equity’ (PLSE) and Wayne Jacobs of ‘Ex-Offenders for Community Empowerment,’ the workshop will explain ways to explore record expungement and the Pennsylvania pardon process.
